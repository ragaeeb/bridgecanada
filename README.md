<a href="http://bit.ly/meghna-hugo-installation" target="_blank" title="meghna hugo installation" rel="nofollow"><img width="100%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37659754/70844354-4028be00-1e6a-11ea-8d84-02e9a25e7db8.png"></a>

In this tutorial, we will show you to make your website live without buying any hosting and touching a single line of code.

### What you need !!

1. Git acccount (Ex: GitHub, GitLab etc ). In our case, we use Github.
2. [Netlify](https://bit.ly/netlify-account) account to host files and add custom domain.
3. [Forestry](https://bit.ly/forestry-account) account to maintain whole project without code.


### Step 1 : Fork or Clone repository

First we will fork this [Meghna Hugo](https://github.com/themefisher/meghna-hugo) template.

### Step 2 : Add your repository in Forestry

Go to your [Forestry](https://bit.ly/forestry-account) account and click on `import your site now`. Declare your config.toml file [`exampleSite`] and fill up basic settings.

**Or just click this button for import to forestry** [![import to forestry](https://assets.forestry.io/import-to-forestryK.svg)](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=themefisher/meghna-hugo&engine=hugo&version=0.60.1&config=exampleSite)

Now mark everything as done. Then go to configuration to change the base url. You can put any url but this have to be similar as netlify. So, for now, put a name which you are going to put in netlify as netlify subdomain.

### Step 3 : Setup and host website with Netlify

Here comes the last step . Go to your [netlify](https://bit.ly/netlify-account) account and click add new site . Choose your git repository to import your website in netlify .  And now you can see the forked `meghna hugo` theme. select it and follow the steps. Then go to `site settings` for change the site name and put your subdoamin name here what you puted on forestry as base url. save it and go to `deploy` from top menu, Wait a while and click on `site preview` or just simply go to the subdomain you puted as base url.

**Or just click this button to connect netlify** [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/themefisher/meghna-hugo)

**BOOM! Your site is live.** Now you can go to forestry and add, remove or customize every setting and content.
